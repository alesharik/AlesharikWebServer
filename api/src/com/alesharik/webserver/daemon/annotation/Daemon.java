/**
 * AlesharikWebServer daemons are threads, which run concurrently with server. Daemons are basically improved Daemon Threads,
 * which can be configured from xml configuration, support hooks, and can be monitored. Daemon can set it's priority by @{@link Priority} annotation.
 * Daemons support inheritance.
 * Lifecycle:<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link Parse} - parse config in main thread</li>
 * <li>{@link Setup} - setup daemon in daemon thread</li>
 * <li>{@link Run} - main daemon code, executed in daemon thread</li>
 * <li>{@link Reload} - executes iin daemon thread when daemon must be reloaded. Default realisation is: {@link Shutdown} -> {@link Parse} -> {@link Setup} -> {@link Run}</li>
 * <li>{@link Shutdown} - shutdown daemon. Executes in caller thread</li>
 * </ol>
